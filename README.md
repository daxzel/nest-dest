# Nest-Dest - a nest showcase
A Heating/Cooling cost calculator.

Used technologies: **Scala**, **Akka**, **Akka-HTTP**, **Akka-streams**, **Angular**, **Websockets**

I understand that:
  * I don't have comments (except parts which I've copied-pasted)
  * I don't have unit test neither JS nor Scala
  * I don't process exceptional cases (such as writing letters to those cost fields)

Mostly due to the lack of time.
