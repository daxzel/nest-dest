# nest-dest - a nest showcase
Heating/Cooling cost calculator.
Used: **Scala**, **Akka**, **Akka-HTTP**, **Akka-streams**, **Angular**, **Websockets**
I understand that:
⋅⋅* I don't have comments (except parts which I've copied-pasted)
⋅⋅* I don't have unit test neither JS nor Scala
⋅⋅* I don't process exceptional cases (such as writing letters to those cost fields)
mostly due to the lack of time
